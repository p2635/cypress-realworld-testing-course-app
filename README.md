# Real World Testing with Cypress - Courses

This repo was cloned from: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-testing-course-app. This files here relate to the Testing your first application course on [learn.cypress.io](https://learn.cypress.io/). However, I have also documented my progress for the other courses on the website:

1. Testing Your First Application - How to test your first application with Cypress.
2. Testing Foundations - The fundamentals and testing basics you need to write great tests.
3. Cypress Fundamentals - The fundamentals of Cypress you must know.
4. Advanced Cypress Testing Concepts - Some of the more advanced Cypress testing concepts that take your tests to the next level.

## Course 1: Testing Your First Application (complete) - [course link](https://learn.cypress.io/testing-your-first-application)

Introductory hands-on course with practical exercises.

- How to install Cypress
- How to write Cypress E2E tests
- How to create custom Cypress commands
- App Install and Overview
- Installing Cypress and writing your first test
- How to test forms and custom Cypress commands
- How to test multiple pages
- How to test user journeys

## Course 2: Testing Foundations (complete) - [course link](https://learn.cypress.io/testing-foundations)

Theoretical course but I am already familiar with the content, quizzes complete.

- Testing is a Mindset
- Identifying What to Test
- Manual vs Automated Testing
- Who should be responsible for testing?
- The Testing Pyramid

## Course 3: Cypress Fundamentals (completed-ish) - [course link](https://learn.cypress.io/cypress-fundamentals)

Theoretical course, which expands a little bit on course 1 without specific instructions to implement. Quizzes are completed but there are additional (practice) links given (https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-testing-blog), which I can clone separately and practice. I have writtern an asterisk below to revisit.

- How to use Aliases
- How to chain methods and assertions together
- How Cypress works 'under the hood'
- How to Write a Test (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Cypress Runs Tests in the Browser
- Command Chaining
- The Asynchronous Nature of Cypress
- Waiting and Retry-ability
- How to Debug Failing Tests*
- Cypress is just JavaScript*

## Course 4: Cypress Fundamentals (TO DO) - [course link](https://learn.cypress.io/advanced-cypress-concepts)

I'm going to leave this for now and focus on practical 'learn by doing' courses, I will revisit later and potentially add links to show where I have demonstrated profiency in these areas.

- How to debug test failures
- Database initialization and seeding
- How to test network requests
- Database Initialization and Seeding
- Running in Continuous Integration (CI)
- Intercepting HTTP Requests
- API and Integration Tests
- Building Custom Commands
- Viewport and Browser Testing
- Cypress Methods You Need to Know
- Using Data for Dynamic Tests
